# SpeculativeHybrids

In Speculative Hybrids, we explore the potentials of Machine Learning for architectural design and therefore investigate how its use enhances design processes in the early design phases. In detail, we suggest the implementation of CPCGAN (https://github.com/SymenYang/CPCGAN), trained with a dataset (https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/3thtp7mc6z/1) of building geometries in the form of annotated point clouds.

Speculative Hybrids are newly model-generated building geometries that are characterized by the features of the dataset that was used to train the model, within the context of site-specific regulations.
Our hypothesis lies upon those hybrids and their ability to inspire architectural practitioners in the ideation phase through exploration. Their purpose is to bridge the gap between creativity and functionality.
The iterative power of such a tool and the design solutions it can provide can inspire practitioners of the field and assist them in structuring fundamental problem space.
